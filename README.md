# Blockbuster Timers

A simple HTML/JavaScript app that allows the user to have timers for a certain board game without having to purchase AAA batteries or a screwdriver.

# How it Works

There are two parts to this app. However, they're very similar to each other (in fact, there's only one major difference).

When a button is pressed, a timer (timeOut) starts, indicated by a ticking sound effect. When the timer runs out, a buzzer sound effect plays, signifying that a player's time is up.

Rules for the game this is meant for are on the app itself.
